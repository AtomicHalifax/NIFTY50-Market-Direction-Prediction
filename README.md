## 🚀 Overview

Predicting financial markets is a challenging time-series classification problem due to market volatility, non-linearity, and continuously changing economic conditions.

This project develops a complete **Machine Learning pipeline** to predict the **next-day direction of the NIFTY 50 Index** by combining domestic market data, global financial indices, currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and engineered technical indicators.

Rather than focusing solely on model performance, this repository emphasizes **reproducible experimentation**, **systematic feature engineering**, and **engineering best practices** throughout the complete ML lifecycle.

The project follows a structured machine learning workflow beginning with historical market data collection and progressing through preprocessing, feature engineering, chronological data splitting, model development, hyperparameter tuning, feature refinement, and final evaluation.

This modular workflow ensures reproducibility while minimizing data leakage in a financial time-series environment.

# Data Collection

<p align="center">
<img width="1376" height="768" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f70032bc-24d2-48f8-823b-9bc7f4bff7dd" />

Historical market data was collected using the **Yahoo Finance API (yfinance)**.

## Dataset Summary

| Property | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Data Source | Yahoo Finance |
| Market | NIFTY 50 |
| Auxiliary Markets | VIX, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Dow Jones, USD/INR, Crude Oil |
| Frequency | Daily |
| Period | 2008 – 2026 |
| Prediction Task | Binary Classification |

The collected datasets were aligned by trading date before preprocessing and feature generation.

# Feature Engineering

<p align="center">
<img width="1376" height="768" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f92e72a-5753-4416-9aa1-4f53a8f6ccef" />


Raw market prices alone rarely capture the complete dynamics of financial markets.

To improve predictive capability, several technical indicators were engineered to represent trend, momentum, and volatility.

## Trend Indicators

- Simple Moving Average (SMA)
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

## Momentum Indicators

- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- MACD
- Rate of Change (ROC)

## Volatility Indicators

- Bollinger Bands
- # Time-Series Split

<p align="center">
<img width="1376" height="768" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/798105bf-e547-4a61-8698-ec11cb2e7e33" />

</p>

Unlike conventional machine learning tasks, financial markets exhibit strong temporal dependencies. To preserve chronological order and eliminate data leakage, a **time-based split** was adopted instead of random sampling.

## Dataset Split

| Dataset | Period | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Training | 2008 – 2022 | Model training |
| Validation | 2023 – 2024 | Hyperparameter tuning |
| Testing | 2025 – 2026 | Final model evaluation |

This strategy closely reflects real-world deployment, where models are trained on historical data and evaluated on future unseen observations.

# Model Development

<p align="center">
<img width="1376" height="768" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67191f2d-db6d-484e-843a-9622f5965dd0" />
  
Model development followed an iterative, experiment-driven process rather than relying on a single model configuration.

### Version 1 — Baseline Models

The initial models were trained using the original market features to establish a performance benchmark.

### Version 2 — Engineered Features

A comprehensive set of technical indicators was introduced to enrich the feature space and capture trend, momentum, and volatility characteristics.

### Version 3 — Feature Refinement

The most informative engineered features were selected through feature importance analysis, followed by hyperparameter tuning to improve generalization performance.

This progressive development strategy enabled systematic evaluation of each enhancement while maintaining reproducibility.
